Their vaults are filled with signed contracts that, if broken, cause the debtor's logic to collapse (Aetherial) or their roots to wither (Sylvae). They stabilize inter-race trade by acting as the ultimate guarantor, ensuring that even if two races go to war, their financial obligations to one another remain intact.",
